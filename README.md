## Objective üéØ
This project simulates a Hospital reception system and includes:
- Client Registration
- User Registration
  
The users are:  
- Doctor
- Patient
- Company/Employee

Through an integration between a *Relational Database* (**MySQL**) and *Forms Windows* (**C#**), we will have a basic system for client registration and service usage.

# System Windows

## ADMConnection Form - Database Connection Window

This window is responsible for receiving the database connection credentials, which are passed through methods like `setConnection()`. With a design that aligns with the project‚Äôs proposal, this is the user‚Äôs first interaction with the interface.
